# OSAC

[![API Spec](https://img.shields.io/badge/API_Spec-OpenAPI-6BA539?logo=openapiinitiative&logoColor=white)](https://osac-project.github.io/osac/)

This is the mono-repo for the [Open Sovereign AI Cloud (OSAC)](https://github.com/osac-project)
project. It hosts multiple components as subdirectories, each retaining its own
documentation:

- **[fulfillment-service/](fulfillment-service/README.md)** — a gRPC server (with REST gateway)
  that manages infrastructure resources such as clusters, hosts, compute instances, and
  networking. It uses PostgreSQL for storage and OPA for authorization, and ships an `osac` CLI
  alongside the service binary.
- **[osac-operator/](osac-operator/README.md)** — a Kubernetes operator that reconciles the
  custom resources created by the fulfillment service (or elsewhere), such as `ClusterOrder`,
  `ComputeInstance`, `Tenant`, `VirtualNetwork`, `Subnet`, and `SecurityGroup`. It provisions
  infrastructure via Ansible Automation Platform and includes a console proxy for KubeVirt VM
  console/VNC access.
- **[osac-aap/](osac-aap/README.md)** — the Ansible automation layer: playbooks, roles, and
  collections that provision and manage infrastructure resources (networking, compute,
  bare-metal hosts, OpenShift clusters) when triggered by osac-operator via Ansible Automation
  Platform (AAP).
- **[osac-csi-driver/](osac-csi-driver/README.md)** — an aggregating CSI meta-driver that
  presents a single CSI identity to Kubernetes and routes storage requests to vendor-specific
  CSI drivers (NetApp Trident, VAST, Pure Storage) based on storage tier resolution from the
  fulfillment service.

See each subdirectory's `README.md` (and `docs/`, where present) for setup, build, test, and
deployment instructions specific to that component.

## Local development with go.work

The root [`go.work`](go.work) file wires `fulfillment-service`, `osac-operator` (plus its
`api` submodule), `bare-metal-fulfillment-operator`, and `osac-csi-driver` together as a Go
workspace, so cross-module changes can be built and tested locally without publishing
intermediate versions. Go tooling run from the repo root will automatically use the
workspace; no extra flags are needed.
